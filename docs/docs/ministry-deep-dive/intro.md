## OpenGIN Entity Mapping

:::info How entities map to OpenGIN

Every item in this analysis carries a **kind** with `major` and `minor` fields, following OpenGIN's entity classification:

| Kind | Major | Minor | Example |
|------|-------|-------|---------|
| Act | `Legislation` | `act` | Health Services Act, No. 12 of 1952 |
| Ordinance | `Legislation` | `ordinance` | Medical Ordinance, No. 26 of 1927 |
| Statutory Body | `Organisation` | `statutory-body` | Health Council |

**Relationships** are expressed as string ID references between entities (e.g., an act's `crossReferences` array contains IDs of related acts). This allows the data to be directly imported into OpenGIN-compatible systems for graph-based exploration.
