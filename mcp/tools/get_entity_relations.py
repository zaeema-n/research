        Fetch the relationships of a specific entity, optionally filtered by related entity,
        relationship name, direction, or time.

        Use this to explore how entities are connected — e.g. which ministries a person belongs to,
        or which departments are under a ministry.

        Use `search_entities` first to get the entity ID if you only have a name.

        Inputs:
          - `entity_id` (required): ID of the entity whose relationships to fetch
          - `id` (optional): ID of a specific relationship — if given, all other filters are ignored
          - `related_entity_id` (optional): filter to relationships involving this specific entity
          - `name` (optional): filter by relationship name (e.g. "AS_MINISTER", "AS_DEPARTMENT")
          - `direction` (optional): OUTGOING (entity → other) or INCOMING (other → entity)
          - `active_at` (optional): ISO 8601 — return only relationships active at this exact moment
          - `start_time` (optional): ISO 8601 — return relationships which started at this time
          - `end_time` (optional): ISO 8601 — return relationships which ended at this time

        IMPORTANT: `active_at` and `start_time`/`end_time` are mutually exclusive — use one or the
        other, never both.

        If no filters are given, all relationships are returned.

        Returns a string consisting of a list of relationships, each with: id, relatedEntityId, name, startTime, endTime, direction.
