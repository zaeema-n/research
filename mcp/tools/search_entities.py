        Search for entities in the OpenGIN knowledge graph by ID, kind, name, or date.

        Use this as the FIRST step whenever you need to work with a specific entity but only
        have a name or type — it gives you the entity ID required by all other tools.

        You must provide either:
          - `id`: returns that exact entity (all other fields ignored), OR
          - `kind_major`: required if id is not given (e.g. "Organisation", "Person", "Dataset")

        Optional filters (only apply when id is not given):
          - `kind_minor`: sub-type of the entity (e.g. "cabinetMinister", "citizen", "tabular")
          - `name`: partial name match (case-insensitive)
          - `created`: ISO 8601 datetime — filter by creation date
          - `terminated`: ISO 8601 datetime — filter by termination date

        Returns a list of matching entities, each with: id, kind (major/minor), name, created, terminated.
